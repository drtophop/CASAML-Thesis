Abstract:

Classic production facilities, such as foundries or machine parks, are typically equipped with a large number of machinery and tools to produce goods while minimizing rejects. To optimize the output, the parameters of all production devices form a vast multidimensional parameter set with a significant amount of production data. One aspect of this data stream involves counting the number of goods and rejects, which can be challenging in classical foundries and often requires manual intervention. This preliminary work aims to present a basic implementation for counting good castings and rejects, with the goal of further improvement, understanding, and incorporating additional features in the future.

Since a dataset of castings is not available, the implementation will utilize custom datasets containing car data obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/
